# ReifyDB - Programmable Backend Database

## About ReifyDB

ReifyDB is a **programmable backend database** that integrates **storage**, **logic**, and **access control** in one
engine.  
Your frontends, apps, and AI agents can query it **directly** - no custom APIs or glue code.

---

## Core Capabilities

- **Direct Client Access** - WebSocket + HTTP APIs for frontends and agents
- **Unified Storage Model** = Tables, counter, locks, ... , and documents in one system
- **Programmable Logic** - Run custom logic inside the database with WebAssembly

---

## Philosophy

> "Your database should be your backend."

We design ReifyDB so you can:

- Eliminate unnecessary API layers
- Ship faster by talking to the DB directly
- Keep data logic, storage, and access rules in one place
- Power both **human-facing apps** and **AI agent workflows** without extra infrastructure
